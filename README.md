## Summary
The goal of the project was to identify authentic news and fake news from public information using NLP.
- Exploratory Data Analysis - I analyzed the columns of the data. Performed text statistics, word frequency, and n-gram analysis. Used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for  topic modeling to compare fake and not fake news.
- Modeling - I used a deep learning algorithm for fake news detection and compared some neural network architecture.

## Codes
The codes related to:
- EDA
- Text and Title modeling
are present in the Python_Notebook_Codes folder.
